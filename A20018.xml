            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Tis a Proverb, The child thats borne muſt be kept, though't be a baſtard, ſeeing tis murder by the law to make away even the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully begotten. If the rugged cadence of this Verſe, and ſcurrile harſhneſſe of this ſubiect, doe chance to eſcape a murdring cenſure <hi>(Quod Dij pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us omen in ipſum)</hi> If: then the Tranſlator vowes to conclude, that either Signior <hi>Malevole</hi> his ſure of Gumme is fretted out at elbowes, and hee put to the naked ſhift of keeping his chamber (tis well he hath a chamber;) or at leaſt the ſubiect of this Booke is entertained with ſuch abiection, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction like your breath-broaker in a Midſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vacation can find no ſubiect to worke vpon. Many a man may <hi>Petere ſibi ſimile,</hi> that intends not <hi>Procreare ſibi ſimile,</hi> may take a ſnatch and away,
<pb facs="tcp:10022:3"/>
that would be loth to be tied to racke and manger, or paſſe billes of ſope and candle. Tis my caſe: Who, though in the minority of my grammar-ſchollerſhip, I was induced by thoſe, whom du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie might not withſtand, to vnmaske theſe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man manners, and put them on an Engliſh face; notwithſtanding, witneſſe my native baſhfull ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, how diſtant it ever was from my deſires; nay, how I ever feard to be preſſed to death, by the publike cenſure of thoſe, who (as I have heard) have it by Patent to ſcandalize whatſoever vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoes the publike Preſſe. The truth is, this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation was halfe Printed ere I knew who had it: So that <hi>Quo fata trahunt,</hi> without prevention or correction the fooles bolt muſt needes be ſhot. And this is it. Thoſe which miſlike the verſe in Engliſh, let them reade it in Latine (for I allowe no miſlikers, vnleſſe at leaſt they can reade Latin) &amp; then perhaps thei'le wonder that a man of ſuch wiſedome as my Author, being neyther borne a Roman, nor a <hi>Naſo,</hi> ſhould with ſuch confidence of a generall applauſe publiſh ſo elaborate a trifle: from which admiration of yours, I hope your curteſie will derive a miracle viz. my pardon, eſpecially conſidering that both <hi>Ovid</hi> and <hi>Virgill</hi> (both Poets Laureat) have beene metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into as indigeſt and breathleſſe a kind of verſe

as this. All that I can ſay for my Author, is, hee ſpeakes broad Engliſh, but by contraries: all for myſelfe, is, tis a Punies tranſlation onely, an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, howſoever (fathered vpon me, becauſe I taught him Engliſh, yet begotten without my preſence, borne before my witte, and publiſhed againſt my will, vnleſſe wee may be ſaide to will what we can not prevent.

            <l>goes currant for no ſin.</l>

                  <l>Then e're they could, before they with this hot perfume did meete.</l>
                  <l>They cannot well forget this kindeneſſe, if you have your due,</l>

                  <l>Muſt have a care, that all his gueſts with craft be over-tooke.</l>
                  <l>That banquet, laſt it ne're ſo long can bring to thee no gaine,</l>
                  <l>Although by keeping thee from ſleepe, it put thee to great paine.</l>

                  <l>Then be thou ſure in any caſe, thou never tell him right.</l>
                  <l>Perhaps the Cocke doth tell you plaine, t'was ten the clocke ſtrucke laſt,</l>
                  <l>Yet be not thou aſhamde, to ſay that it is twelve and paſt.</l>
                  <l>Though no man aske, yet tell them this each houre, on thine owne head,</l>
                  <l>That they may know the better, that its time to go to bed.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>If neither they reſpect thy words, nor yet the time thats paſt.</l>
                  <l>Then warne them flatlie, that each perſon to his houſe make haſte.</l>
                  <l>And though your maſter did not bid you, thus his gueſts to vſe,</l>
                  <l>Yet if you do ſo, this his credite cannot much abuſe.</l>
                  <l>I doubt not, but your maſter would himſelfe have ſaid the ſame,</l>
                  <l>If that it would not have beene preiudiciall to his fame.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>As ſoone as they halfe-drunken, do beginne to part away,</l>

                  <l>Set ope the doores I ſay, and freely lend them ſtore of light,</l>
                  <l>And tell each man which is the way, vnto his owne houſe right.</l>

                  <l>Be take thee to thy chamber, there at length to take thy reſt.</l>

                  <l>And when another in his hand, doth hold the pot to drinke,</l>
                  <l>Demand it from him, and he cannot ſay thee nay, I thinke.</l>
                  <l>If he deny to give it, till his thirſt be quencht at full,</l>

                  <l>Regarde them not, but though they ſhould be raving mad for drinke,</l>
                  <l>Yet keepe the pot, and vſe it when thy ſelfe moſt fit dooſt thinke.</l>

                  <l>VVHenas the cloth is tooke away, and every pleaſing baite,</l>
                  <l>Cleane water for to waſh is ſet vpon the table ſtrait.</l>
                  <l>Slouth is a vice; then, leſt thou ſhouldſt be ſlouthfull, it is beſt</l>
                  <l>To thruſt thy hands into the boſome firſt before the reſt:</l>
                  <l>Then waſh thy face and mouth whenas thou thinkſt the time moſt fit,</l>
                  <l>And water all thy noſtrils with the pleaſing deaw of it.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:10022:46"/>When thou haſt waſht, then let the water for thy fellowes ſtand,</l>
                  <l>Which is made fowle enough already by thy dirtie hand.</l>
                  <l>Let married wives waſh after thee, though beautifull they bee,</l>
                  <l>And though the virgine be ſo fine, yet let her waite on thee.</l>
                  <l>Cleane water from thy filthie hands, will waſh the dirt the more,</l>
                  <l>Than that which hath with dirtie hands, been dirtie made before.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Yet oftentimes, you many men ſhall finde to be ſo neate,</l>
                  <l>That thei'le not touch the water firſt, vnleſſe you them intreate.</l>
                  <l>They looke that others ſhould beginne, and when the reſt have done,</l>
                  <l>Then thei'le beginne to waſh their hands, and to the baſen come.</l>
                  <l>As thus they ſtand, (well meaning men) deſiring to be laſt,</l>
                  <l>Be ſure that thou good ſtore of water, dooſt vpon them caſt.</l>
                  <l>Take water in thy hand, and caſt it boldly in their face,</l>
                  <l>Sprinkle it in their eyes, their head, or any other place.</l>
                  <l>Thats all the good, which by their manners they ſhall get of thee,</l>
                  <l>T'will make them that another time, they wiſer men will bee.</l>
                  <l>Amongſt a ſort of honeſt folkes, one tride this tricke of late,</l>
                  <l>But ſped not well, for all the harme returned on his pate.</l>
                  <l>For thinking certaine wives, with water thus to circumvent,</l>
                  <l>They by their craftie fore-ſight, did his policie prevent.</l>
                  <l>He ſcarce could ope his eyes to ſee, the water ſtopt them ſo,</l>
                  <l>And all his briſly beard, with ſtore of water ſtreames did flow.</l>
                  <l>He being thus diſgrac'd, and loth thus baſely there to yield,</l>
                  <l>Preſumed rather to proceede, then thus to looſe the field.</l>
                  <l>He tooke the baſon in his hands, and from him ſtowtly threw,</l>
                  <l>As well the baſon as the water, mongſt the female crew.</l>
                  <l>The ſtrangers all laught merrily, at this ſo ſuddaine hap,</l>
                  <l>And every man and woman there beganne his hands to clap.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Or whenas none to put his hands in firſt, dares be ſo raſh,</l>
                  <l>But every man lookes when his neighbour doth beginne to waſh,</l>
                  <l>Becauſe ſuch gravitie, doth to the gueſts great credite get,</l>
                  <l>And each man thinks ſuch pompe as this, is for his credite fit.</l>
                  <l>If theſe their manners do from waſhing them, too long detaine,</l>
                  <l>Thou maiſt before the reſt, great ſtore of praiſe and credite gaine.</l>
                  <l>If ſeeing no man all this while, beginnes to waſh his hand,</l>
                  <l>Thou ſuffer not the water, longer in that place to ſtand.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:10022:46"/>Why ſhould the river water, baſely thus vſurpe that place,</l>
                  <l>Which was preparde, a better liquor farre, the wine to grace?</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>At length, perchance a banquet to the ſecond boord is brought,</l>
                  <l>The beſt place heere, leſt ſome prevent thee, muſt of thee be caught.</l>
                  <l>Thoſe iunckets which are beſt of all, thou oughtſt to ſnatch vp firſt,</l>

                  <l>Turne round the diſh on every ſide, till thou haſt found the beſt,</l>
                  <l>And having found them, ſnatch them without ſhame before the reſt.</l>
                  <l>If that you thinke that Nature ſerves all creatures from one well,</l>
                  <l>You are deceivde, for things in goodnes other things excell.</l>
                  <l>The divers differences made among mens mindes that live,</l>
                  <l>Is not in vaine, ſince carefull nature divers gifts doth give.</l>
                  <l>But God himſelfe of maſters vſe having a ſpeciall care,</l>
                  <l>Provideth greater gifts to give, to them that maſters are.</l>
                  <l>That thus each man in his degree, might thus diſtinguiſh theſe,</l>
                  <l>And every man might chooſe thoſe things, which beſt their humours pleaſe.</l>
                  <l>Vſe iudgement then, and let no raſhnes in thy deedes be ſpide,</l>
                  <l>And for thy ſelfe from out each diſh, the ſweeteſt bits provide.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>It is not needefull that from apples, thou ſhouldſt pare the skinne,</l>
                  <l>To do that which may needeleſſe ſeeme, thou never ſhouldſt beginne.</l>
                  <l>That ſo thy meate receivde, the better may concocted bee,</l>
                  <l>The paring of the greeneſt apple, muſt be eate of thee.</l>
                  <l>For if too long in paring of thine apple, thou ſhouldſt ſtay,</l>
                  <l>The reſt which in the platter lies, will ſoone be ſnatcht away.</l>
                  <l>And when from forth the diſh, to take another tis thy minde,</l>
                  <l>Thou art prevented of thy purpoſe, thou not one canſt finde.</l>
                  <l>Therefore, as long as any bit is left, ceaſe not to eate,</l>
                  <l>Thou ſhalt not every day perchance, meete with ſuch daintie meate.</l>
                  <l>Have ſtill a care to leave no bit behinde you when you riſe,</l>
                  <l>For if you do, your hoſt will thinke that you his fruit deſpiſe.</l>
                  <l>He did not therefore ſet them on, that you ſhould them refuſe,</l>
                  <l>Then if you leave them thus, your carefull hoſt you ſhall abuſe.</l>

                  <l>The ſhells would flie againſt the pots, and into ſtrangers eyne,</l>
                  <l>And often times would make the pot halfe crackt, to leake the wine.</l>
                  <l>Meane time, while this their ſtrength was very much admirde of mee,</l>
                  <l>Becauſe I thought them ſurely full of fortitude to bee.</l>
                  <l>I in another place, a ſort of luſtie fellowes found,</l>
                  <l>Stamping vpon their nuts, and picking them from off the ground.</l>
                  <l>Thou maiſt of both theſe follow either, onely ſpare thy knife,</l>
                  <l>Leſt being conquerd by a nut, it chance to looſe its life.</l>

                  <l>The ſhell vpon thy neighbours trencher, thou maiſt kindely ſet.</l>

                  <l>Thy credite thou maiſt ſave, and prove thou haſt a loving heart.</l>
                  <l>And giving ſo much to thy friend, that thou no glutton art.</l>
                  <l>The companie thereby may know thou art no greedie gueſt,</l>
                  <l>But thou canſt barre thy throat from meate, whenſe're thou thinkeſt beſt.</l>
                  <l>Perchance while thou art eating, thou amongſt thy meate maiſt finde</l>

                  <l>To put a ſpurre vpon his heele he alſo had a care,</l>

                  <l>Each part for to anotomize ſhe thought it mickle paine,</l>

                  <l>A Cittizen did on a time with feaſting entertaine</l>

                  <l>The fiſh by great ill lucke from forth his fingers ſlipt away.</l>
                  <l>But ere it came to ground, his ſlipper with the ſame did meete,</l>
                  <l>A ſlipper blacke as jeate was on the entertainers feete.</l>
                  <l>Whence having tooke it, it vpon the Princes trencher laid,</l>
                  <l>And that his fault might ſeeme the leſſe, theſe words to him he ſaid:</l>

                  <l>Another time a gentleman of worſhip and of fame,</l>

                  <l>The ſtranger being finely nurturde wondrous haſte did make,</l>

                  <l>Not willing for to looſe his part this tricke he did invent,</l>

                  <l>This yonker ſcarce was ſuffered his horſes backe to leave,</l>

                  <l>That every man muſt after ſupper leade a wench a dance.</l>
                  <l>This yonker then, (although this dancing he did hardly love,)</l>
                  <l>Was forc'd according to the fiddles ſound his legs to move.</l>
                  <l>Each time that he remov'd his feete, he ſhooke the maſſie ground,</l>
                  <l>And all the houſe with ſtore of ſhowts and Ecchoes did reſound.</l>
                  <l>As oft as ere this yonker from the ground his legs did pull,</l>
                  <l>(Having his bootes (too big before,) with ſtore of water full:)</l>
                  <l>So oft they forc'd him to remember that vnſeemely thing,</l>
                  <l>And oft the fault forgot, they did afreſh remembrance bring.</l>
                  <l>And then afreſh each man began at him to laugh and mocke,</l>
                  <l>He was the cauſe that made himſelfe ſo baſe a laughing ſtocke.</l>
                  <l>As ſoone as dancing time was paſt that he might private bee,</l>
                  <l>He found a means whereby from laughter he himſelfe might free.</l>
                  <l>In midſt of all the maides and men which compaſt him apace,</l>
                  <l>He put his watry buskins off, the cauſe of his diſgrace.</l>
                  <l>And gave them to his man, that to the fire he might them beare,</l>
                  <l>Which quickly would exhauſt the vapors that within them were.</l>
                  <l>His truſtie ſervant by the way eſpide a bed by chance,</l>
                  <l>Provided for to reſt their bones which in the hall did dance.</l>
                  <l>Hither the carefull ſervant did his maſters buskins beare,</l>
                  <l>And having made the bed-poſte fit, he forthwith hung them there.</l>
                  <l>And then began the youth to baniſh care from forth his breaſt,</l>
                  <l>Beginning once againe to be as iocond as the reſt.</l>
                  <l>But now the time of drowſie mid-night had approached nie,</l>
                  <l>And every ſtranger made him readie to his bed to hie.</l>

                  <l>And therefore was he forc'd to riſe, thinking to walke abroad,</l>

                  <l>The doores by chance were lockt, and therefore he could finde no way,</l>

                  <l>In briefe, he found the bootes vpon the bed which there did ſtand,</l>

                  <l>Hoping by meanes thereof to get ſome credite at his neede.</l>
                  <l>And hanging it vpon a naile which there he did eſpie,</l>
                  <l>Such pleaſant words as theſe, began to ſpeake immediatly.</l>
                  <l>Enough, enough at length of ſorrow and of pining care;</l>
                  <l>Tis time at length to laugh and quaffe with thoſe which merry are.</l>
                  <l>There hang the Doctor which the crabbed leſſons vſde to reade,</l>
                  <l>Mirth more befits this pleaſant crew, this is no time to pleade.</l>

                  <l>And riſing, asked pardon of him for that great diſgrace,</l>

                  <l>And every one began a cup of wine to him to drinke,</l>
                  <l>And thus the Doctor got his grace and honour due I thinke.</l>

                  <l>And after in that pleaſant iorney he a day had ſpent,</l>
                  <l>Being both wearie and be-nighted, to an Inne he went,</l>
                  <l>Within the ſelfe ſame Inne a maid that night her lodging tooke,</l>

                  <l>One man there was among the reſt which greatly diſallowd</l>
                  <l>In ſecret ſort, that any ſcholler ſhould be thought ſo prowd.</l>
                  <l>For having in another place his fellow lately beene,</l>
                  <l>He knew the ſcholler, and his pride he oft before had ſeene.</l>
                  <l>Having a wit which he before in divers ieſts had tride,</l>
                  <l>He practiſde divers meanes whereby the ſcholler to deride;</l>
                  <l>Still noting all the fooliſh trickes which in him he could finde,</l>

                  <l>For vnto it with all my heart I lent my liſtning eare;</l>
                  <l>But for becauſe more weighty matters doe my preſence crave,</l>
                  <l>The reſidue thereof to morrow willingly weele have.</l>
                  <l>Meane time the King deviſed many pollicies to vſe,</l>
                  <l>Whereby the Rethoritians vtterance he might abuſe.</l>
                  <l>As ſoone as ere the morrow came, the Scholler he did call,</l>
                  <l>To make an end of his begunne Oration in the hall.</l>
                  <l>By chance a baſe and ſimple man was thither ſent for too,</l>
                  <l>Which for a little ſilver any beaſtly tricke would doe:</l>
                  <l>He was ſo well a practiſde man in farting, that he coulde</l>
                  <l>Let farts at any mans commaundement whenſoere he woulde.</l>
                  <l>As ſoone as ere he came, the king in friendly manner ſaide,</l>
                  <l>There is a certaine feate to doe, wherein we lacke thine aide.</l>
                  <l>A Doctors coate and cap vpon him he did quickely place,</l>
                  <l>And tolde him all things which were fitte in ſuch a crafty caſe:</l>
                  <l>The Rethoritian ſpoke as he the day before had done;</l>
                  <l>And at the end of ev'ry ſentence, he to belch begunne.</l>
                  <l>The Doctor alſo not forgetting his enjoyned arte,</l>
                  <l>Beganne at end of ev'ry belch moſt decently to fart.</l>
                  <l>What ſhall the Rethoritian doe? he firſt beganne to chide,</l>
                  <l>The Doctor for his beaſtlineſſe which quickely was eſpide,</l>
                  <l>Thus thinking to proceede in railing at him for the ſame,</l>
                  <l>He thought vpon his owne offence, and then he bluſht for ſhame.</l>
                  <l>Which when the King eſpide, he into laughter ſtrait did breake,</l>
                  <l>And to the bluſhing Rethoritian thus beganne to ſpeake:</l>
                  <l>This Doctor alſo vnto vs from forraine countries came</l>
                  <l>To make a ſpeech: he is a man of great renowne and fame.</l>
                  <l>And as it is your vſe to belch at ev'ry ſentence end,</l>
                  <l>Which in your country as a credite all perhaps commend.</l>
                  <l>To fart in like ſort this our Doctor counts a royall thing;</l>
                  <l>And as a cuſtome from his country hither doth it bring.</l>
                  <l>Which having ſaide, the Rethoritian ſtrait his leave did take,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:10022:74"/>Enforced in the middle of his ſpeech an end to make.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>A man began to tell a tale of newes and manners paſt,</l>
                  <l>The Preface of the which, was like an houre or two to laſt.</l>
                  <l>To which, one man among the reſt gave his attentive eare,</l>
                  <l>As being willing that which he recited for to heare.</l>
                  <l>Meane time his bladder was ſo full, no more it could ſuſtaine,</l>
                  <l>(The keeping of the vrine, often breedeth mickle paine)</l>
                  <l>But (fooliſh man,) the preſent tale ſo much he did effect,</l>
                  <l>That he durſt hardly ſtirre, leſt he the ſtorie ſhould neglect,</l>
                  <l>By chance he had a little purſe made of a Squirrels skin,</l>
                  <l>Which lately he provided had, to keepe his mony in.</l>
                  <l>He thought it better this his purſe with vrine for to fill,</l>
                  <l>Then looſing of that pleaſant ſtorie, ſo to want his will.</l>
                  <l>He knew that vrine held too long, did often danger bring,</l>
                  <l>And therefore carefully prevented ſuch a future thing.</l>
                  <l>Not long a go, a Doctor which in learning well was taught,</l>
                  <l>By this meanes, moſt vnluckily vnto his end was brought.</l>
                  <l>Amongſt a ſort of gallant maides he in a coach did ride,</l>
                  <l>Incompaſſed with ſtore of baſhfull maides on every ſide.</l>
                  <l>Not many houres amongſt the youthfull virgins he had ſate,</l>
                  <l>Talking of chaſte virginitie, and ſuch like harmeleſſe chat.</l>
                  <l>But that his bladder being filld with vrine to the brim,</l>
                  <l>Some ſpeedie paſſage privately it did demand of him.</l>
                  <l>And yet to ſtirre from forth the coach he would not take the paine,</l>
                  <l>Thinking it better any paine or perill to ſuſtaine,</l>
                  <l>He was ſo chaſte, that rather then hee'd trouble maid or wife,</l>
                  <l>He thought it better farre to ſtand in danger of his life.</l>
                  <l>At length, his bladder with ſuch ſtore of vrine was ore-lade,</l>
                  <l>That all his bowells burſt, and ſo the water paſſage had.</l>
                  <l>And he within a day or two was forc'd his life to leave,</l>
                  <l>This was the profite which by ſhamefaſtnes he did receave.</l>
                  <l>Wherefore, leſt thou the like incurre, refuſe not any thing,</l>
                  <l>Rather then thus thy ſelfe in danger of thy life to bring.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>I thinke it good the tale which followes to recite to thee,</l>
                  <l>Becauſe it is a tale which argues great Simplicitie.</l>
                  <l>Of late, a clowne which all the trickes of former times did know,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:10022:74"/>And livde therein, for theſe our dayes can none ſo ſimple ſhow,</l>
                  <l>Came to an antient friend of his whome long he had not ſeene,</l>
                  <l>And when that ſtore of friendly talke had paſſed them betweene;</l>
                  <l>At length they came (as ſtrangers vſe) to couple hand in hand,</l>
                  <l>It is a right on which olde friends do often vſe to ſtand.</l>
                  <l>But firſt to make his noſtrels cleane, the clowne would be ſo bolde,</l>
                  <l>And all the ſnot which thence he tooke he in his hand did holde,</l>
                  <l>And then his antient friend he boldely by the hand did take,</l>
                  <l>Saying, lo, heeres a ſigne how much of thee (my friend) I make.</l>
                  <l>The cauſe why thus he did, was this, he in great feare did ſtand,</l>
                  <l>Leſt that perhaps the tothers fiſt ſhould hurt his tender hand.</l>
                  <l>Wherefore to eaſe his palme with ſoft and tender fleame he meant,</l>
                  <l>That he thereby the future blow the better might prevent.</l>
                  <l>A thouſand ſuch like trickes as theſe I could to thee repeate,</l>
                  <l>The practiſe of the which would make thy fame and credite great,</l>
                  <l>But that I know this little booke of mine too long would bee,</l>
                  <l>If all things which my ſelfe have ſeene I ſhould recite to thee.</l>
                  <l>If by thy wit the things which I have tolde thou practiſe can,</l>
                  <l>I doubt not but thou ſoone wilt proove a rude and ſimple man.</l>

                  <l>The ſimple life of country farmers which the field doe plow,</l>
                  <l>And all their ruſticke trickes muſt be eſteemed deere of you.</l>
                  <l>Thoſe things which other curious Critickes doe exhort thee to,</l>
                  <l>Neglect them all, with gravitie you nothing have to doe:</l>
                  <l>If ſome men you can croſſe, and ſtirre vp laughter vnto ſome,</l>
                  <l>You neede not care for any more, your duety you have done.</l>
                  <l>And now (well nurturde youth) I bid thee kindely to farewell,</l>

                  <l>ME thinks already I have ſaid enough of manners rude,</l>
                  <l>And therefore willingly this preſent booke I would conclude.</l>

                  <l>What ſhall I do? conſent or no? whether will prove the beſt?</l>
                  <l>To do as they require, or contradict their iuſt requeſt?</l>

                  <l>Some precepts I will give, whereby your manners for to frame,</l>
                  <l>They ſhall be few, but you ſhall reape great profite by the ſame.</l>
                  <l>It is not neede for your inſtruction many trickes to tell,</l>
                  <l>You are ſo prone, that all men you in clowniſh trickes excell.</l>
                  <l>Nature her ſelfe, which ſcornes the helpe of any others trade,</l>
                  <l>Vnto all kindes of vice your ſect moſt tractable hath made.</l>
                  <l>Yet notwithſtanding that which vnto me <hi>Apollo</hi> told,</l>
                  <l>Since all I ſpeake is true, to tell it you I dare be bold.</l>
                  <l>You maides which neither modeſt, honeſt, nice, nor baſhfull are,</l>
                  <l>Approach, and for your profits of my precepts have a care.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>When through a publike cittie ſtreetes to wander you deſire,</l>
                  <l>(For my part, I am not enforc'd to looke to your attire.)</l>
                  <l>Permit your wandring gadding eyes in every place to bee,</l>
                  <l>So that before, behinde, on everie ſide, you all may ſee.</l>
                  <l>The minde which nere committed any treſpaſſe may be bold,</l>
                  <l>Each man, each thing in every corner, freely to behold.</l>
                  <l>And with a brazen fore-head, looke the prowdeſt in the face,</l>

                  <l>Hither a certaine woman came their orders for to know,</l>

                  <l>She taking in the matters handling pleaſure at the hart,</l>
                  <l>Having ſo good a place, was loath from foorth it to depart,</l>
                  <l>By chance ſhe had a bag, wherein great ſtore of bookes there was,</l>

               <l>Wherefore the ſhip with all the ſailes I dedicate to thee,</l>

               <l>Or future tempeſts by their raging blaſts, the ſame ſhould breake.</l>
               <l>For what availes it to have caught the long deſired ſhore?</l>
               <l>Or to have ſcap'd thoſe gulfes which ſafely we have paſſed o're?</l>
               <l>Vnleſſe your wonted love and kindenes do me ſtill purſue,</l>

               <l>Although my ſhip at haven ſtands, yet when the windes do blow,</l>
               <l>The raging waves which riſe, my ſhip may quickly over-throw.</l>

               <l>My wavering ſhip from all miſchances when it lies at bay.</l>
               <l>To take tuition of my verſe, of thee I humbly crave,</l>

               <l>I hope of no man elſe my paines can much miſliked bee.</l>
               <l>It may be, few or none at all, will much eſteeme my verſe,</l>
               <l>Becauſe in civill ſort my ieſts I vſe not to reherſe.</l>
               <l>Some men perchance will therefore not my painefull labours love,</l>

               <l>Becauſe forſooth they are not written in a loftie ſtile.</l>
               <l>Will therefore every man condemne my labour and my paine?</l>
               <l>Is both my care, my time, and toile conſumed all in vaine?</l>
               <l>I cannot tell, I looke for better fortune; for I know,</l>

               <l>Within my booke no praiſe-deſerving precepts written are,</l>
               <l>Nor any ſalves which from the minde have force to baniſh care.</l>
               <l>And yet vnleſſe that my coniecture doth me much deceive,</l>

               <l>Manners which clowniſh are, I have ſet downe in clowniſh wiſe,</l>

               <l>Moſt of the trickes which I have writ, my ſelfe before did ſee,</l>
               <l>The reſt, a truſtie friend of mine repeated vnto mee.</l>
               <l>And ſome thereof, (it is no ſhame to tell the naked truth,)</l>
               <l>My ſelfe (as I was apt thereto,) committed in my youth.</l>

               <l>I know ſome prettie cleanly tricke or other he ſhall reade,</l>

               <l>When he eſpies ſome tricke agreeing to his manners fit,</l>

               <l>The bluſhing red which in his viſage to and fro will paſſe,</l>

               <l>I doubt not but ſome ſortes of men will very thankfull bee,</l>
               <l>And ſure I thinke for all my paines ſo much they owe to mee.</l>
               <l>But thou which movedſt me to write, (for onely for thy ſake,</l>
               <l>And no mans elſe (friend <hi>Bing,</hi>) I did this labour vndertake.)</l>
